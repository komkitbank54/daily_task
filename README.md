# Task Tracker (React + Node + MongoDB)

---

## Comment

I have developed many React projects before. But this time I tried to practice by using ChatGPT as little as possible (not for vide coding).
This is the first project where I really tried to practice seriously by myself. I found a lot of my own problems while doing this project.
It is really an easy project for someone else, but after I finish this, I will move on to bigger projects for more challenge to improve myself.

#### I HAVE PAUSED THIS PROJECT FOR NOW. I HAVE A NEW PROJECT IDEA.
